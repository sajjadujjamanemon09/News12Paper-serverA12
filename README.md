**OR Go Through Following The Installation SetUp**

1. **Install React Router Dom**: üëâÔ∏è Open up your terminal and bootstrap a new React app with Vite: We'll be using Vite for our bundler and dev server for this tutorial. You'll need Node.js installed for the `npm` command line tool.

   ```shell
   mkdir 'your project name'
   ```

   This command will automatically download and install all necessary packages and libraries file.

   - **cd your new project directory**: 

   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```



2. **Install**: Install require  files.

   ```shell
   npm i express cors dotenv mongodb
   ```
   - **Initialized Tailwind Project** :

   ```shell
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
   - **Configure your template paths**: Add the paths to all of your template files in your` tailwind.config.js` file.

   ```shell
     content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",],
   ```
   - **Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS**: Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind‚Äôs layers to your `./src/index.css` file.

   ```shell
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

3. **Install daisyUI:**: 

   ```shell
   npm i -D daisyui@latest
   ```
   - **Then add daisyUI to your `tailwind.config.js` files:**
   
   ```shell
     plugins: [require("daisyui")],
   ```
   - **Then go to your `.eslintrc.js` file & add this `env: {browser: true, node: true, es6: true}` into this:**
  
   ```shell
      node: true,
   ```

4. **Setup Router**: Go to `main.jsx` remove `<App/>` & Set this process:

   - **First: Import this**
